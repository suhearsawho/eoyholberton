[Job Odyssey](https://jobodyssey.com) is a web application that is designed to gamify and organize your job search!
To achieve this goal, Job Odyssey provides a unique reward and currency system that is designed to re-energize your job 
search. Users can generate currency by performing certain actions - such as saving a job post, applying to jobs, and 
updating the status of previously applied jobs.
